The Anaerobic Kareoke app can be downloaded at this [link](). 

The title Anaerobic Karaoke refers to "anerobic exercize" wherin a physical task is performed which requires more oxygen than is avaliable in the system, and so the body must rely on breaking down internal energy reserves to keep functioning. Similarly, this piece requires someone to perform "karaoke" in a system devoid of reference or inspiration, instead having to rely on their own internalized creativity and present it as an open declaration of one's own existence. Both tasks yeild great results in confronting uncomfortable situations, with one being an exercize in physical endurance and the other an exercize in vulnerability.

With the app open, first click the question mark to view the performance instructions. Doing so will enable all other options once you return to the primary user interface. If you follow the instructions, the app will apply an instrumental track which is automatically harmonized to your vocals. Rest assured that no matter the result, you cannot fail in perfoming this piece. Click [here]() to see an example of a performance recording.
